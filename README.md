# Overview

## Summary

Legion is a Hadoop MapReduce tool that programmatically extracts columns or fields from large, messy data sources, cleans them, and organizes them into normalized flat files ready for ingestion into relational tables in a data warehouse (e.g., Postgres COPY).

Legion currently supports:

* Input data in JSON (one object per line) or CSV formats
* Combining small files to prevent performance slowdowns
* Gracefully ignoring corrupt files rather than crashing an entire job
* Validating data in each individual field or column
* Splitting a single input (e.g., a JSON object with an array) into multiple, normalized outputs (e.g., a table for the objects, and another for the array elements)
* Handling compressed data with improper file extensions
* Re-ordering CSV columns for consistency
* Etc.

Hadoop developers may also be interested in leveraging individual Legion components (e.g., input formats) in other MapReduce jobs.

## Origins

Legion was originally developed at Republic Wireless, where we've applied it to over a dozen problems. These include:

* Combining hundreds of thousands of small CSV files uploaded to our servers every day by our Android app out in the field. Legion lets us deal with corrupt files (either unreadable or containing bad data), harmonize data streams from old and new versions of our app, and deal with incorrect file extensions.
* Normalizing JSON log data from our switching servers. Legion lets us split a single stream of JSON objects containing arrays of arrays into several different files that fit our normalized database schema.

# Usage

## The Basics

Legion comes with a pre-configured job that handles all of the use cases described above. You can execute this job by calling the Hadoop `jar` command, with the Legion jar as the target jar and `com.rw.legion.DefaultJob` as the `mainClass`.

The default Legion job expects three additional arguments of its own:

1. Input location
2. Output location
3. Location of Legion "objective" file

All together, you get something like this:

```
hadoop jar /path/to/Legion.jar com.rw.legion.DefaultJob /in /out /path/to/objective.json
```

## Objective files

A Legion objective file is a JSON document that specifies:

* `inputFormat` - `InputFormat<NullWritable, LegionRecord>` to use for reading data. Legion comes with several, but you can also load anything on your classpath.
* `outputTables` - An array of objects specifying output tables that Legion should create.
* `codecOverride` - Hadoop codec class to use for reading input, if you want to override default behavior. Optional.
* `maxCombinedSize` - `maxInputSplitSize` for input formats that combine files (see [CombineFileInputFormat](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.1/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/input/CombineFileInputFormat.html)). Optional.

Each object in the `outputTables` list should specify:

* `title` - The title of the table, for differentiating output files.
* `columns` - An array of objects that specifies what columns this table should contain.
* `indexes` - An array listing the names of indexes to be used for this table. Optional. (See section on indexes below.)

Each object in the `columns` list should specify:

* `key` - The key (CSV column header or modified JsonPath) used to find the data for this column in the input data.
* `failOnAbsent` - If true, entire record will be rejected if this column key does not appear. Otherwise, this column will be null. Optional. Defaults to false.
* `failOnNull` - If true, entire record will be rejected if this column contains null. Optional. Defaults to false.
* `failOnValidation` - If true, entire record will be rejected if this column contains data that doesn't pass validation. Otherwise, this column will be null. Optional. Defaults to true.
* `validate` - A JSON object with validation information for this column.
  * `class` - `ColumnChecker` to use for this column. Legion comes with several, but you can also load anything on your classpath.
  * `options` - Any properties that should be used to instantiate the `ColumnChecker`. For example, `IntegerChecker` requires type of integer.
* `transform` - A JSON object with transformation information for this column.
  * `class` - `ColumnTransformer` to use for this column. Legion comes with several, but you can also load anything on your classpath.
  * `options` - Any properties that should be used to instantiate the `ColumnTransformer`. For example, `NullReplaceTransformer` requires a string to be used for replacing nulls.


## JsonPaths

For JSON data, Legion uses a modified (highly simplified) version of JsonPaths. Essentially, the root of your JSON object is `$`. You can select attributes or sub-attributes by using dots. For example, `$.name` or `$.compensation.salary`. If there's an array in the JSON object, you can access elements using square brackets. For example, `$.states[23].capital`. That's all there is to it.

## Simple use case

Suppose you have a CSV that looks like this:

~~~
first_name,last_name,salary
yolanda,jones,50000
john,smith,ILOVEJUSTINBIEBER
chris,brown,12000000
~~~

And you have a database table that looks like this:

~~~SQL
create table employees (
    last_name varchar(255),
    first_name varchar(255),
    salary int
);
~~~

You might be interested in accomplishing a couple of things to prepare this data for ingestion. First, you might want to re-organize the data so that employee last names come before first names. Second, you might want to throw out salary values that don't match the integer data type, so that your database import won't crash.

A simple Legion objective to accomplish that would look like this:

~~~JSON
{
    "inputFormat": "com.rw.legion.input.CsvInputFormat",
    "outputTables":
    [
        {
            "title": "employee",
            "columns":
            [
                {
                    "key": "last_name",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "first_name",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "salary",
                    "failOnValidation": false,
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.IntegerChecker",
                        "options": {
                            "intType": "int"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
~~~

Legion will generate output that looks like this:

~~~
jones,yolanda,50000
smith,john,
brown,chris,12000000
~~~

Clean and ready for import!

## Indexes for table normalization

Suppose you have a file full of JSON objects that look like this (pretty-printed here for illustration purposes):

~~~JSON
{
    "inventor_id": 1,
    "first_name": "john",
    "middle_name": "avery",
    "last_name": "whittaker",
    "patents": [
        {
            "patent_no": 12345,
            "title": "super scooper"
        },
        {
            "patent_no": 67890,
            "title": "instant freezer"
        }
    ]
}
~~~

If you were loading this data into a relational database, you'd likely want to have a table of inventors and a table of patents, with each record in the patent table containing a foreign key (inventor_id) linking it to its inventor. This can be accomplished using "indexes" in Legion.

A Legion index is simply a named placeholder for a numerical value that might appear in the key for certain repeated data points. It is surrounded by angle brackets in the actual key definition so Legion can identify and use the index. Keys must also be listed in the table definition itself, as mentioned above.

In the above example, since Legion uses JsonPath notation to determine keys for JSON attributes, you'll end up with keys for patent numbers that look like `$.patents[0].patent_no` and `$.patents[1].patent_no`. If you wanted to use an index to create a generic string that would match both of these keys, you could use `$.patents[<patentIndex>].patent_no` and include `patentIndex` in the list of indexes for your patents table.

If that's all clear as mud, this example should help:

~~~JSON
{
    "inputFormat": "com.rw.legion.input.JsonInputFormat",
    "outputTables":
    [
        {
            "title": "inventor",
            "columns":
            [
                {
                    "key": "$.inventor_id",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.IntegerChecker",
                        "options": {
                            "intType": "int"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "$.first_name",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "$.middle_name",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "$.last_name",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                }
            ]
        },
        {
            "title": "patent",
            "indexes": ["patentIndex"],
            "columns":
            [
                {
                    "key": "$.inventor_id",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.IntegerChecker",
                        "options": {
                            "intType": "int"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "$.patents[<patentIndex>].patent_no",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.IntegerChecker",
                        "options": {
                            "intType": "int"
                        }
                    }
                },
                {
                    "key": "$.patents[<patentIndex>].title",
                    "validate": {
                        "class": "com.rw.legion.columncheck.StringChecker"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
~~~

This will produce two CSVs. The first will have a prefix of "inventor" and look like this:

~~~
1,john,avery,whittaker
~~~

The second will have a prefix of "patent" and look like this:

~~~
1,12345,super scooper
1,67890,instant freezer
~~~

That's it! You can go as deep as you want with the indexes, and Legion should hold up!

# Future development

We've got all kinds of ideas for feature additions and improvements for Legion. These include:

* Additional `ColumnTransformer`s for things like converting numeric types.
* Additional `ColumnChecker`s for things like checking a value against a list of acceptable values.
* Allow CSV input files to be splittable (in the Hadoop sense of the word).
* Support URL query string input data
* Etc.

Please feel free to contribute if you are interested/able!
